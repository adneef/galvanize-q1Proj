Thanks for playing Star Blaster!

This game was built over the course of a week for my Q1 project for Galvanize.

I used the Phaser game library, javascript, a little bit of HTML, a bit of CSS,
and a whole lot of image editing in GIMP and mac os Preview.

Thanks to all of these internet people for their help and guidance and great, free products
even though I've never met any of you:
